# Hibiscus Sense ESP32 Arduino Tutorial

Hibiscus Sense <[Purchase Here](https://myduino.com/product/myd-036/)> is an Internet of Things (IoT) development board powered by the mighty and popular dual-core ESP32 microcontroller, embedded with 3 sensors (APDS9960, BME280 & MPU6050) and 2 actuators (Buzzer & LED / RGB LED), makes it easy for you to kick start your awesome IoT project. Since the microcontroller is the mighty ESP32, this development board is compatible to be programmed using tools such as Arduino IDE (for Arduino programming language), Thonny IDE (Micropython programming language) or ESP-IDF (C, C++ programming language), simply use the latest USB Type-C to program the microcontroller, which has built-in USB-to-Serial converter (Silicon Labs CP2104) with automatic bootloader reset, so you donâ€™t have to press the RESET button each time to upload the program into the microcontroller.

In this tutorial we will focus on using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) as the prototyping platform.
